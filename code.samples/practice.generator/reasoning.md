# Generator: Practice
## Questions:
- What do I want to do here?
- When do I need a generator?

I want to capture a non-deterministic amount of input from the user, and terminate the program when the input does not satisfy a condition (for example when input is an empty string).

In order to do that, the easiest way is to utilize a looping construct. A simple while loop can do the job. However, I want to see if I can use the generator, to capture the next input and check whether it is a valid input, before passing it up for further operations.
